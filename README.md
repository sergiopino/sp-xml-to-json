Summary of the steps required to create and publish your sp-xml-to-json package on NPM:

Initialize your project by running npm init in your terminal. This will create a package.json file that you can use to configure your package.

Install the dependencies required by your package. For this package, you'll need the xml2js library. You can install this library by running npm install xml2js --save in your terminal.

Create a bin directory at the root of your project, and create an sp-xml-to-json.js file inside it. This file will contain the command line tool that you're creating. You can use the xml2js library to convert XML to JSON.

Add a bin field to your package.json file, and set the value to bin/sp-xml-to-json.js. This will tell NPM that your package provides a command line tool.

Create a test directory and create a test file inside it. This file should test that your command line tool is working correctly.

Install Jest by running npm install jest --save-dev. This will allow you to write and run tests for your package.

Update your package.json file to include a test script that runs Jest.

Write and run tests for your package by running npm test. Make sure that all tests pass.

If you haven't already, create an account on the NPM registry by running npm adduser. Follow the prompts to create your account.

Update the version number in your package.json file using the npm version command. For example, you can run npm version 1.0.0 to update the version number to 1.0.0.

Build your package by running the following command: npm run build. This will compile your code and create a dist directory that contains the compiled version of your package.

Make sure you have a README file in the root directory of your package. This file should contain information about your package and instructions on how to use it.

Verify that your package includes all the necessary files and dependencies by running the following command: npm pack. This will create a .tgz file in your project directory, which you can inspect to make sure all the necessary files and dependencies are included.

Publish your package to the NPM registry by running the following command: npm publish. This will upload your package to the NPM registry and make it available for others to install and use.

After publishing, you can verify that your package is available on the NPM registry by running the following command: npm view <package-name>. Replace <package-name> with the name of your package as specified in your package.json file.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to create and publish your sp-xml-to-json package on NPM.
